# Next Word Prediction with GRU & Early Stopping
Welcome to Next Word Prediction, a deep learning project that leverages Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Early Stopping to generate Shakespearean text. Trained on Shakespeare's Hamlet, this model predicts the next word in a sequence with remarkable accuracy. A Streamlit-powered web app is included for an interactive experience, making this project both technically robust and user-friendly.

This repository contains a structured pipeline from data preprocessing, training, and model saving to real-time predictions via an intuitive web UI.

# 🔥 Why This Project Stands Out
✅ State-of-the-Art GRU Model – Designed for efficient sequence prediction.
✅ Optimized with Early Stopping – Prevents overfitting and ensures better generalization.
✅ Fully Interactive Web App – Built with Streamlit for seamless word prediction.
✅ Robust Tokenization – Uses Keras Tokenizer, saved as a .pkl file for reusability.
✅ Shakespearean Elegance – Trained on Hamlet, making predictions uniquely sophisticated.

# 🏗️ Project Workflow
1️⃣ Preprocessing & Tokenization (exp_2.ipynb) – Cleans the text, tokenizes words, and prepares sequences.
2️⃣ Model Training (exp_2.ipynb) – Implements a GRU-based model with early stopping, ensuring efficiency.
3️⃣ Model Saving & Testing – Stores the trained model (model.h5) and tokenizer (tokenizer.pkl) for deployment.
4️⃣ Real-Time Predictions (app.py) – A Streamlit app that allows users to input a phrase and receive predicted words dynamically.

# 💡 Future Enhancements
🔹 Experiment with LSTMs & Transformers for improved accuracy.
🔹 Train on larger datasets for enhanced text generation.
🔹 Improve the Streamlit app UI with visualizations and history tracking.
